## What is Codex

Codex is a simple tool for building static webites. It takes a template constructed in
[Jade](http://github.com/visionmedia/jade) and themed in [Stylus](http://github.com/learnboost/stylus),
and applies it to a collection of Markdown documents. The result is a complete html site
that can be hosted using your favorite static webserver, or on github-pages.
