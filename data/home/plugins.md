### Available Plugins

The Chai community is growing! Plugins allow developers to expand Chai's available 
assertions. Here is what the community has come up with so far:

* [chai-spies](https://github.com/logicalparadox/chai-spies) is a basic spy implementation for chai. It's also
a good resource for building chai plugins that work in both node.js and the browser.
* [chai-jquery](https://github.com/jfirebaugh/chai-jquery) by [@jfirebaugh](https://github.com/jfirebaugh)
provides deep jQuery integration with chai `should` and `expect`.
* [jack](https://github.com/vesln/jack) by [@vesln](https://github.com/vesln) is a mock/stub library that 
can be used as a stand-alone or with chai.
* [sinon-chai](https://github.com/domenic/sinon-chai) by [@domenic](https://github.com/domenic) extends chai with 
assertions for the Sinon.js mocking framework.
